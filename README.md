# Fake-vs-Real-News-Prediction
Early fake news detection aims to give early alerts of fake news during the dissemination process before it reaches a broad audience. Therefore, early fake news detection methods are highly desirable and socially beneficial.  The goal of this project is to detect fake news shared on social media, specifically on Twitter. A binary classification machine learning model will be developed to detect patterns in the article or post, it will classify the news as Fake(1) or Real(0).   In the data analysis part, aside from analyzing the news contents and titles using Natural Language Processign techniques, we also analyzed the social interaction dynamics in fake and real news dissemination on Twitter.
